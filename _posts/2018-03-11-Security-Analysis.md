## Security analysis DropTap connections
The DropTap is a Raspberry Pi 3 with a USB network dongle which will bridge a connection between a device and its end point. The device can be inserted into a unsuspecting network or within a malicious network which will need mitigation.
![Overall DropTap Overview ](https://tap.apt-get-sudo.com/assets/img/DropTapImages/DropTap1.jpeg)

| Component name |
|----------------|
| Network cable attached to DropTap and source |

| Category of vulnerability |
|---------------------------|
|Malicious traffic evasion |

|Issue Description |
|------------------|
|This component exposes a additional hop between source and destination, A attacker could use this additional hop to attempt to hide malicious traffic |

| Mitigation |
|------------|
|The DropTap will utilize a bridge network which should not be noticeable from the source or destination components |


| Component name |
|----------------|
|Network cable attached to DropTap and original input |

| Category of vulnerability |
|---------------------------|
|Malicious traffic evasion |

|Issue Description |
|------------------|
|This component exposes a additional hop between source and destination, A attacker could use this additional hop to attempt to hide malicious traffic |

| Mitigation |
|------------|
|The DropTap will utilize a bridge network which should not be noticeable from the source or destination components |




## Security analysis DropTap UI
The DropTap is a Raspberry Pi 3 with a mobile device for user interaction. The Raspberry pi it self is hosting a web service that the user connects to

| Component name |
|----------------|
|Packet capture interface basic network tools |

| Category of vulnerability |
|---------------------------|
|Network DoS |

|Issue Description |
|------------------|
|This component exposes a potential ability to exceed network traffic to various services from within a network and potentially degrade performance |

| Mitigation |
|------------|
|The DropTap will utilize a hardcoded network limit of how many packets it will be capable of sending while in passive mode |



| Component name |
|----------------|
|Packet capture interface Packet Capture list |

| Category of vulnerability |
|---------------------------|
|Sensitive data exfiltration |

|Issue Description |
|------------------|
|This component exposes exit node for captured packets, a rogue DropTap could be inserted into a network and all traffic can be sent to a malicious user |

| Mitigation |
|------------|
|The DropTap will utilize live traffic capture with no PCAPS or packet storage capabilities |



## Security analysis DropTap Hardware
The DropTap is a Raspberry Pi 3 with a mobile device for user interaction. The Raspberry Pi will utilize a network adapter to enable a network bridge

| Component name |
|----------------|
|Raspberry Pi Wifi |

| Category of vulnerability |
|---------------------------|
|Network DoS |

|Issue Description |
|------------------|
|This component exposes a potential ability deny service on expected wifi channels |

| Mitigation |
|------------|
|The DropTap will utilize all available techniques to provide a stable connection to the mobile user when possible |
